## üó∫Ô∏è Overview

MUSCLE is widely-used software for making multiple alignments of biological
sequences. Version 5 of MUSCLE achieves highest scores on several benchmark
tests and scales to thousands of sequences on a commodity desktop computer.

pyMUSCLE5 is a Python module that provides bindings to MUSCLE v5 using
[Cython](https://cython.org/). It directly interacts with the MUSCLE
internals, which has the following advantages:

- **single dependency**: If your software or your analysis pipeline is
  distributed as a Python package, you can add `pymuscle5` as a dependency to
  your project, and stop worrying about the MUSCLE binaries being properly
  setup on the end-user machine.
- **no intermediate files**: Everything happens in memory, in a Python object
  you fully control, so you don't have to invoke the MUSCLE CLI using a
  sub-process and temporary files. Sequences can be passed directly as
  strings or bytes, which avoids the overhead of formatting your input to
  FASTA for MUSCLE.
- **no OpenMP-dependency**: The original MUSCLE code uses [OpenMP](https://www.openmp.org/)
  to parallelize embarassingly-parallel tasks. In pyMUSCLE5 the dependency on
  OpenMP has been removed in favor of the Python `threading` module for better
  portability.

## üí° Example

Let's load some sequences sequence from a FASTA file, use an `Aligner` to
align proteins together, and print the alignment in two-line FASTA format.

### üî¨ [Biopython](https://github.com/biopython/biopython)

```python
import os

import Bio.SeqIO
import pymuscle

path = os.path.join("pymuscle", "tests", "data", "swissprot-halorhodopsin.faa")
records = list(Bio.SeqIO.parse(path, "fasta"))

sequences = [
    pymuscle.Sequence(record.id.encode(), bytes(record.seq))
    for record in records
]

aligner = pymuscle.Aligner()
msa = aligner.align(sequences)

for seq in msa.sequences:
    print(f">{seq.name.decode()}")
    print(seq.sequence.decode())
```

### üß™ [Scikit-bio](https://github.com/biocore/scikit-bio)

```python
import os

import skbio.io
import pymuscle

path = os.path.join("pymuscle", "tests", "data", "swissprot-halorhodopsin.faa")
records = list(skbio.io.read(path, "fasta"))

sequences = [
    pymuscle.Sequence(record.metadata["id"].encode(), record.values.view('B'))
    for record in records
]

aligner = pymuscle.Aligner()
msa = aligner.align(sequences)

for seq in msa.sequences:
    print(f">{seq.name.decode()}")
    print(seq.sequence.decode())
```

*We need to use the [`view`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.view.html)
method to get the sequence viewable by Cython as an array of `unsigned char`.*
